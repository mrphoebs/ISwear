A simple promise abstraction for java

A Promise
---------
A promise is a synchronizing construct in concurrent programming that "promises"
to eventually hold some value which is usually the result of an asynchronous computation
or process. It provides no guarantees on the timeliness of the computation. When someone
tries to get the value of a promise, the promise blocks until the value is realized.
A promise can be realized by either full-filling it with a value(the value of computation)
or breaking it. *ISwear* is a simple promise abstraction and a few example implementations
for java.
